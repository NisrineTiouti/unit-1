**1)  Variables in Computer Programming:**
_Variables_ are used to store information to be refrenced and manipluated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name. so our programs can be understand more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to lable and store data in memory. This data can be used throughout your program.

**2) Types of variables in Python**
Pyhton variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve space the declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
The operand to the left of the = operator is te name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.
_the types of variables:_
-int (signed integers), they're positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point e.g: 3, -5
-float (floating point real values), they're a number or a string that can be converted into a floating point number 
-complex ( complex numbers), it returns a complex number when real and imaginary parts are provided, or it converts a string to a complex number.
-strings ( text) e.g: "hello"
- Boolean and None, are to indicate true or false value. You can assign any variable to be true or false and declaring a variable as Boolean.

**3) The four CTS : ( Common Type System)
- System Software: System software helps the user, the computer or mobile device, and an application all work together seamlessly. This makes sytem software crucial to running any kind of application software as well as the whole computer sytem. e.g: macOS
- Programming Software; Programming software is for computer programmers and developers who are writing code. These are programs tha t are used to write, develop, test, and debug other software programs. e.g: compilers
- Driver Software: it operates and controles devices that are plugged into a computer. 
- Application Software : this is the most common type of software, and can bedefined as end-user programs that help you perform tasks or achieve desire outcome. e.g:  a photo-editing program like Adobe or LIghtroom.
