**Question 1:** **Do you think it is necessary to involve the shop owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer** 
 
  .I think it is better to involve him during the process along the three weeks. That way the client will be aware of our progress and can inform us if they want anything changed or if they're happy with what we're doing so far. It is always important to get the client's insight it will make them feel included in the process and will come to understand your work and appreciate it more. Though this involvement should be limited you don't want to bore them with every detail and with the technical terms that they might not fully understand.
  
  **Question 2** **Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?**

   . I think MVPs are necessary for my game. The MVPs would be under planning step by step. First we would send out the proposed solution and the tools we'll use to solve it along with justfications as to why we chose those tools to get the clients approval in case there is any changes they may want before moving to the next step, Design. In that step we draw a system diagram, to visualize where the game is running. Then, flow diagram that showcases the general idea of thet game from start to end excluding details....
   
   **Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.**
   
   .Yes, its quite similar. Each step of the cycle has a similar definition in comparison to the design cycle for developing software. Observation is when we define the problem before us, idea generation is when we generate our proposed solution for this issue, then we turn that idea to written code i.e prototyping and finally we have to test if the code is working and matches the criteria that we set up. 
    
  **Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.**
 
 .Obseravtion is when we study the world and notice some problems, we start thinking of solutions and generating ideas, we move on to prototyping i.e where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms from paper to digital. Finally testing, to make sure everything works in unision.
    
 **Question 5: Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Playersâ€™ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:**
   
   .I think i can improve the Players' experience is if we get their approval each step of the way, something that they can test and see if it works for them, that way they can make changes during the process, we avoid wasted time and resources and the Player's happy with the final product.
