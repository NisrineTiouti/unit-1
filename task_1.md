**Question 1:** **Do you think it is necessary to involve the shop owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer** 
 
  .I think it is better to involve him during the process along the three weeks. That way the client will be aware of our progress and can inform us if they want anything changed or if they're happy with what we're doing so far. It is always important to get the client's insight it will make them feel included in the process and will come to understand your work and appreciate it more. Though this involvement should be limited you don't want to bore them with every detail and with the technical terms that they might not fully understand.
  
  **Question 2** **Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?**

   . I think MVPs are necessary for my game.
