*The steps to design cycle are :*
- Creating a sytem diagram
- Writing personal reasons for choosing the theme of the game 
- Making 3 flow diagrams from the game 
- Creating a test plan for your proposed soltuion 
*Correction:*
-Planning
-Design
-Development 
-Evaluation
-Implementation

2) The purpose of succes criteria is defining clear success measurments for your proposed solution in order to define if it was succesful or not, and to check at the end if you have met these criterias or not.

3) I understand more the language of a computer and how people are able to program a game, and how tedious that process can be.  
I also think that if i were asked to draw a computer this time it would be different from my previous drawing that i did at the start of the year.
Since now i know a bit of the main parts a computer is composed of, like a CPU which in a way represents the brain of the computer.

4) What i understand more about myself right now after this first Unit is:
 - I am someone who is very persistent 
 - I always try to take a creative approach to a project and incorporate some type of design or art to it
 
 5) What worked for me weel during the developement process is :
 - Keeping my ideas simple and not going above and beyond my current knowledge of Computer Science 
 6) What did not work for me is:
 - At times i do not think about how the code will go together before writing it so it would take me a lot of time to try and figure out the issue.
 
 8)
 - I don't think a developer is only responsible of meeting the success criteria, a developer before anything else is a human so the ethics and morals that goes into being human goes into being a developper, seperating between both of these identities can cause huge consequences.
